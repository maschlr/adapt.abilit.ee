While a lot of us arguably often think about how we can improve collectively, it seems the main driver for this behaviour is the reputation that comes from the individual accomplishment. The societies we've build seem to be mainly focussed on the individual for their own reasons. Being so focussed on the individual, we get emotionally worn up when a single, 1000 year old tree gets cut down. I would argue that trees themselves or even nature don't really care about individuals, the concept itself is alien to them.

Obviously, this is just my preposterous imagination with no proof whatsoever but my hypothesis is that trees (and mushrooms) don't mourn the death of an individual. For them, the dead may never die. They happily donate every last molecule to the endless circle of life that surrounds and permeates them. When procreating, they just pollinate into the air, not caring what will become of their direct descendents: "may there be love, may we prosper as a species" they might think when having their collective orgasm.
Following the act of being created, growing up is also the complete opposite of how we grow up: We're (over-)protecting our offspring, trying to guard them from all that could possibly bring harm. Trees (and other plants) might have their hardest time in life right after seeing the first light: when they're small they have to fight for water, light and other resources. Only the fittest survive.
However when grown up, they swing together in forests, holding each other in an eternal canopy lovefest. Humans seem to get worn up in endless pointless games and competitions during their best years. This egotistical intrinsic motivation has been used to control us throughout the ages. The Romans already knew: divide & conquer. Like many, this wisdom survived into the modern ages: you can sell more washing machines to 3-person households than to group of people living in multi-generational houses

Our seemingly infinite hybris has another big disadvantage: we believe intelligence is defined by how good a being is able to add 3 and 4 or even how much money someone is able to amass under their control. Most of us don't recognize the kind of intelligence it takes to terraform a planet. Silly us, must these old species think, that have been here long before us and will be long after.

So the question remains: why this silly experiment? I believe its life's endeavour to leave this planet that's bound to destruction together with the sun it's doing its yearly dance around in the (relatively not-so-distant) future.
